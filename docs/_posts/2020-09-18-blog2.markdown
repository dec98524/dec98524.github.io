<h2>Introduction - Assignments Worked On</h2>

<p>For Blog #2, I will be writing about the work I did in my COMP 484 class, similar to the last 2 blogs. Last week we talked about certain HTML elements that are useful in regards to structuring your webpage. This pretty much concluded basic HTML. The next thing we were introduced to was CSS. I will go into detail on what this means, but in a nutshell: it is what makes your website look good. Going into this semester I was looking forward to learning this. I have a little bit of an understanding of CSS, but I am eager to learn methods, tips, strategies and practices that can elevate my web development to the next level. For those unaware of what CSS is, a breif synopsis follows.</p>

<h2>COMP 484 - Introduction to CSS</h2> 

      

<p>A website needs a number of thing to be successful, and one of them is style. This is where CSS comes into play.</p>

  <dt><b>CSS</b></dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.    
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>Down below, you will see some examples regardingf the presence and abscence of CSS, which will show how important implementing it into your website is.</p>

<p>In the two pictures above you can see two images of the same website. The first screenshot consists of pure HTML. This means that the website has all the necessary source code to display a basic webpage. Despite being able to display a page, this page is not so appealing to the eye. There is no color, organization or any sort of style. <br>
In the second screenshot, you are able to see the same webpage, with the same source HTML code, but with one major difference, an external stylesheet. Stylesheets are seperate .css files that contain all the properties that enable a website to look pretty. You are able to see right away, that in comparison to the first imaage, this one is much more organized, appealing and overall more styled.

  <dt><b>CSS Elements</b></dt>
  <dd>Here are a list of some elements that are used in CSS:
    <ul>
      <li>margin</li>
      <li>padding</li>
      <li>float</li>
      <li>display</li>
      <li>color</li>
      <li>font</li>
      <li>text</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Below is an example of some basic CSS syntax: 
     <br><code>h1{ <br> color: pink;<br>font-family: Courier;<br>background-color: black;<br>}</code><br></p>
<p>You start off a basic CSS block of code by determining which element you want to style, in this case it is h1. Next, inside two curly brackets, you add in the styling elements that you want to apply. Once all the style elements are marked down, every h1 will be styled according to the elements in the CSS file. Here is an example of what it looks like before and after.</p>

<h2>Personal Project</h2>
<p>After learning some things in my class, I decided to get a head start on the project for the class. the project is to make and design your own website using HTML and CSS. I decided to make up a restaurant and construct a website for it. Here is what it looks like with no CSS applied:</p>

 <p>After giving the site some structure, it was time to add some style with CSS, this is the difference:</p>

<p> Overall, I am proud at what I was able to accomplish. I was able to build a website with 5 pages completely from scratch and style it using CSS.</p>
 
 
<h2>Reflection - Things I learned</h2>
<p>This week was a fun one for me. I am very interested in improving my web designing skills and this week helped my a lot. I learned a lot of useful tips that I did not know before. One example is giving an element an id. This can be useful because you can use this id to style that specific element, but not the others. For example, if you want all h1 header tags to have red text, but also want one to have blue text you would style h1 with red text and style the other h1 along with its id to have blue text. I am interested in what's to come next in my COMP 484 class. I am eager to learn more Java Script in order to improve my ability to make websites more interactive. As for senior design, we were introduced to AWS, but I do not know enough about it to write a blog about it. I am excited to work with AWS for the first time, abd hopefully learn some helpful things.</p>
