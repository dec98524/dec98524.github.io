<h2>Introduction - Assignments Worked On</h2>

<p>For Blog #2, I will be writing about the work I did in my COMP 484 class, similar to the last 2 blogs. Last week we talked about certain HTML elements that are useful in regards to structuring your webpage. This pretty much concluded basic HTML. The next thing we were introduced to was CSS. I will go into detail on what this means, but in a nutshell: it is what makes your website look good. Going into this semester I was looking forward to learning this. I have a little bit of an understanding of CSS, but I am eager to learn methods, tips, strategies and practices that can elevate my web development to the next level. For those unaware of what CSS is, a breif synopsis follows.</p>

<h2>COMP 484 - Introduction to CSS</h2> 

      

<p>A website needs a number of thing to be successful, and one of them is style. This is where CSS comes into play.</p>

  <dt><b>CSS</b></dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

<p>Down below, you will see some examples regardingf the presence and abscence of CSS, which will show how important implementing it into your website is.</p>

<p>In the two pictures above you can see two images of the same website. The first screenshot consists of pure HTML. This means that the website has all the necessary source code to display a basic webpage. Despite being able to display a page, this page is not so appealing to the eye. There is no color, organization or any sort of style. <br>
In the second screenshot, you are able to see the same webpage, with the same source HTML code, but with one major difference, an external stylesheet. Stylesheets are seperate .css files that contain all the properties that enable a website to look pretty. You are able to see right away, that in comparison to the first imaage, this one is much more organized, appealing and overall more styled.

  <dt><b>CSS Elements</b></dt>
  <dd>Here are a list of some elements that are used in CSS:
    <ul>
      <li>margin</li>
      <li>padding</li>
      <li>float</li>
      <li>display</li>
      <li>color</li>
      <li>font</li>
      <li>text</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Below is an example of some basic CSS syntax: 
     <br><code>h1{ <br> color: pink;<br>font-family: Courier;<br>background-color: black;<br>}</code><br></p>
<p>You start off a basic CSS block of code by determining which element you want to style, in this case it is h1. Next, inside two curly brackets, you add in the styling elements that you want to apply. Once all the style elements are marked down, every h1 will be styled according to the elements in the CSS file. Here is an example of what it looks like before and after.</p>

<h2>Reflection - Things I learned</h2>
<p>After completeing all my assignments this week, there were definitely some new things I learned. One of the main things I learned was the importance of a LAMP stack and the role it plays in web development. Despite many of my peers using Docker in previous classes, this was the first time I had used Docker. I ran into some issues while doing the lab, for example, at the end of the lab I was getting some error messages. I checked the class Slack channel and realized others were having the same issue. Without the Slack channel, I would not have been able to complete the lab assignment. As for my COMP 484 work, I definitely learned some useful tips. In the past, when making HTML files, I would not use tags such as main, article and section. I now understand the importance of these tags and the ARIA roles. They allow the code to be legible, and can help with styling and scripting large amounts of similar code. Structure is very important when it comes to building websites and these tags are the way to properly structure your HTML file.</p>
