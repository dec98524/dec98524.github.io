<h2>Introduction - Assignments Worked On</h2>

<p>Welcome back to my blog site! For Blog 1, I will be discussing various assignments I worked on this week, things I learned and even things I struggled with. Once again, I will be discussing the stuff I worked on in my COMP 484 and CIT 480 classes. This week in COMP 484 I was given three homework assignments all relating to HTML. In addition to those assignments, I was also given a lab to work on in my CIT 480 class. This lab consisted of using a program known as Docker to build a lamp stack. In the sections below, Iâ€™ll discuss each assignment, covering the steps I took to complete them. At the end, you can find a reflection where I will cover what I learned.</p>

<h2>CIT 480 - Lab 1 - Lamp Stack</h2> 

<p>This assignment consisted of installing certain  and using it to install packages via the command line and using web server software to display the webpage. The first step I had to do was install Docker.</p>

After getting familiar with a few of the Docker commands, the next step was to install Apache.
