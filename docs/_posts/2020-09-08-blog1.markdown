<h2>Introduction - Assignments Worked On</h2>

<p>Welcome back to my blog site! For Blog 1, I will be discussing various assignments I worked on this week, things I learned and even things I struggled with. Once again, I will be discussing the stuff I worked on in my COMP 484 and CIT 480 classes. This week in COMP 484 I was given three homework assignments all relating to HTML. In addition to those assignments, I was also given a lab to work on in my CIT 480 class. This lab consisted of using a program known as Docker to build a lamp stack. In the sections below, Iâ€™ll discuss each assignment, covering the steps I took to complete them. At the end, you can find a reflection where I will cover what I learned.</p>

<h2>CIT 480 - Lab 1 - Lamp Stack</h2> 

<p>This assignment consisted of installing certain  and using it to install packages via the command line and using web server software to display the webpage. The first step I had to do was install Docker.</p>

  <dt><b>Docker</b></dt>
  <dd>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.</dd>

<p>To install docker, visit <a href="https://www.docker.com/" style="text-decoration: underline">docker.com</a> and click on get started.<br>
     Then click on the download tab and select your corresponding operating system.
