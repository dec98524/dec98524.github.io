<h2>Introduction - Assignments Worked On</h2>

<p>For Blog #3, I will be writing about some cool new things I learned in my COMP 484 class. Last week I talked about the basics and fundementals of CSS. We discussed how usefull CSS can be when it comes to styling your webpage. What we talked about last week was just the begining, there is so much more to CSS, so much so that I learn new things everytime I work on a project. This week I will go into greater depth regarding CSS. I will cover how to design a basic webpage, while making it visually appealing. I will discuss various CSS elements in addition to the basic ones we learned last week. </p>

<h2>COMP 484 - Using CSS to Structure</h2> 

      

<p>For this blog, we will specifically go over how to design a webpage that contains: a header with navigation, a body with blocks of various content, and a footer with contact information. </p>


 <h1>Getting Started - Header Section</h1>  

<p>Whenever you visit a website, the first thing you see, in most cases, is a header. *This is not the header element, below is the distinction:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Header</b></dt>
  <dd>A header is typically located at the top of the website and should be consisted across all pages within the site. In the header, you can expect to find a navigation, containing links redirecting you to important parts of the page.     
    </dd>
     <dt><b>Header Tag</b></dt>
  <dd>The header tag represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.     
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>After creating a basic page using all the necessary HTML elements, the next step is to establish a heaser section. We will use the div tag to establish a section for the header. Insert the following block of code into your file:
    <br><code>  &lt;div id="header"&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt; <br> </code><br>
</p>
 
    
<p>What this does is establish a section, which we can style, for the header. The next step is to ad CSS. in your.css stylesheet file, insert the following:
     <br><code>  #header {<br> overflow: hidden; <br>background: #080a42;<br> }<br> </code><br>
    The #header will style the div element with the id of header. Overflow set to hidden will contain everything in the div and the background color allows you to select a color of your choice. This is what you should have so far:

  <dt><b>CSS Elements</b></dt>
  <dd>Here are a list of some elements that are used in CSS:
    <ul>
      <li>margin</li>
      <li>padding</li>
      <li>float</li>
      <li>display</li>
      <li>color</li>
      <li>font</li>
      <li>text</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p> Below is an example of some basic CSS syntax: 
     <br><code>h1{ <br> color: pink;<br>font-family: Courier;<br>background-color: black;<br>}</code><br></p>
<p>You start off a basic CSS block of code by determining which element you want to style, in this case it is h1. Next, inside two curly brackets, you add in the styling elements that you want to apply. Once all the style elements are marked down, every h1 will be styled according to the elements in the CSS file. Here is an example of what it looks like before and after.</p>

<h2>Personal Project</h2>
<p>After learning some things in my class, I decided to get a head start on the project for the class. the project is to make and design your own website using HTML and CSS. I decided to make up a restaurant and construct a website for it. Here is what it looks like with no CSS applied:</p>

 <p>After giving the site some structure, it was time to add some style with CSS, this is the difference:</p>

<p> Overall, I am proud at what I was able to accomplish. I was able to build a website with 5 pages completely from scratch and style it using CSS.</p>
 
 
<h2>Reflection - Things I learned</h2>
<p>This week was a fun one for me. I am very interested in improving my web designing skills and this week helped my a lot. I learned a lot of useful tips that I did not know before. One example is giving an element an id. This can be useful because you can use this id to style that specific element, but not the others. For example, if you want all h1 header tags to have red text, but also want one to have blue text you would style h1 with red text and style the other h1 along with its id to have blue text. I am interested in what's to come next in my COMP 484 class. I am eager to learn more Java Script in order to improve my ability to make websites more interactive. As for senior design, we were introduced to AWS, but I do not know enough about it to write a blog about it. I am excited to work with AWS for the first time, abd hopefully learn some helpful things.</p>
