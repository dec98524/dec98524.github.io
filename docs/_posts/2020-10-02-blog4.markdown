<h2>Introduction - Assignments Worked On</h2>

<p>For Blog #4, I will build off of last week's blog and go in depth on how I was able to create the page I showed at the end. In case you missed it, <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://dec98524.github.io/senior/design/2020/09/25/blog3.html">here is a link</a> to last week's blog post where I went over a basic webpage structure. Down below, you will be able to see how I was able to construct and style the header section  of my personal sports blog. After reading this blog, you should have a decent understanding about creating styled header sections, with a constant, consistent structure. This includes a navigation and an image for your site.


      

</p>


 <h1>Styling The Header Section</h1>  

<p>In the last blog, we made a div section for the header, but it was pretty barebones. In my finished product, I included a navigation bar that redirected the user to other important parts of the website. I also included a photo in the header. These are  the steps that were taken to make the header look nice. </p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Step 1 - Insert The Image</b></dt>
  <dd>It is very common to see a photo atop a webpage when visiting a website. This photo can be anything, but is often the logo of whatever company the site is about. In this case, I chose to add a simple wordmark titled David's Sports Blog for my image. So in the header div of the document, I added the following code:
       <br><code>  
       &lt;a href="https://davidwebsite2.glitch.me/"&gt;<br>
        &lt;img<br>
          alt="davids sports blog"<br>
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/d58d3551-a865-47fd-af08-aa7ea179d659%2Fsportsblogtitle.png?v=1600997823450"<br>
          height="300"<br>
          width="350"<br>
        /&gt;<br>
      &lt;/a&gt;<br>
      </code><br>
      The a tag makes the image a clickable link that redirects to the homepage, the src attribute links the image source, the alt attribute provides placeholder text if the image is not loading, and height and width are simply the dimensions. 
    </dd>
     <dt><b>Step 2 - Navigation</b></dt>
  <dd>Having a list of links at the top of a webpage can be useful when traversing a website. It can lead you to and from various pages, making every single page of a website accessible from a single location. In my  case, I added a link to all the [4] pages in my site. First, I added this to my HTML code:
       <br><code>  
      &lt;ul style="float:left;" class="navbar"&gt;<br>
        &lt;li class="navbar"&gt;<br>
          &lt;a href="https://davidwebsite2.glitch.me/pages/angels.html"&gt;Angels&lt;/a&gt;<br>
        &lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &lt;li class="navbar"&gt;<br>
          &lt;a href="https://davidwebsite2.glitch.me/pages/lakers.html"&gt;Lakers&lt;/a&gt;<br>
        &lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &lt;li class="navbar"&gt;<br>
          &lt;a href="https://davidwebsite2.glitch.me/pages/rams.html"&gt;Rams&lt;/a&gt;<br>
        &lt;/li&gt;<br>
        &lt;li class="navbar"&gt;<br>
          &lt;a href="https://davidwebsite2.glitch.me/pages/players.html"&gt;Players&lt;/a&gt;<br>
        &lt;/li&gt;<br>
      &lt;/ul&gt;<br>
      </code><br>
      The ul element constructs an un ordered list, which we will then float to the left. 
      </dd>
</dl>
<p>After creating a basic page using all the necessary HTML elements, the next step is to establish a heaser section. We will use the div tag to establish a section for the header. Insert the following block of code into your file:
    <br><code>  &lt;div id="header"&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt; <br> </code><br>
</p>
 
    
<p>What this does is establish a section, which we can style, for the header. The next step is to ad CSS. in your.css stylesheet file, insert the following:
     <br><code>  #header {<br> overflow: hidden; <br>background: #080a42;<br> }<br> </code><br>
    The #header will style the div element with the id of header. Overflow set to hidden will contain everything in the div and the background color allows you to select a color of your choice. This is what you should have so far:

   <h1>Main COntent - Body Section</h1>  

<p> Now that we have a header established, we need to allocate an area for the main content of the page, the body. The next step is to do what we did for header, make a div for the body. Insert the following block of code into your file: 
     <br><code> &lt;div id="body"&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt; <br> </code><br></p>
     <p>Similar to the header, this makes a section for the body, which we will go on to style. In your.css stylesheet file, insert the following:
     <br><code>   #body{<br>
    overflow: hidden;<br>
    width: 100%;<br>
    max-width: 1000px;<br>
    margin: 50px auto 50px auto;<br>
    padding: 10px;<br>
    height: auto;<br>
    background-color: black;<br>
    border-color: red;<br>
    border-style: solid;<br>}<br> </code><br>
   We already know what the #body part does. But this time we have some extra stuff. We added some margins to add some space to the sides, some padding for similar reasons, a border for style, and a height set to auto to fit all our content. This is what you should have so far:
</p>

    <h1>Wrapping it up - Footer Section</h1>  

<p>The last thing we have to do is simply add a footer. Insert the following block of code into your file: 
     <br><code> &lt;div id="footer"&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt; <br> </code><br></p>
     <p>Typically, footers should stay at the bottom of the page, but they don't do that by default. In your.css stylesheet file, insert the following:
     <br><code>   #footer{<br>
   overflow: hidden;<br>
   position:static;<br>
    background: black;<br> </code><br>
   The difference between this and the header is the position element. We have it set to static in order to assure it stays at the bottom. This is what you should have so far:

<p>With these steps complete, you have a basic webpage set up. In the next section I will cover how I was able to style a page with this structure.</p>

<h2>Personal Project</h2>
<p>Using the same structure discussed in this blog, here is a website I was able to make (just HTML, no CSS yet).</p>

 <p>This is what the site looks like after some CSS:</p>

<p> I like this site much more than my site from last week.</p>
 
 
<h2>Reflection - Things I learned</h2>
<p>I feel like I was able to improve my CSS skills a lot compared to last week. My first site was more of a playground where I was able to get a feel for elements, attributes and terms. This week, I took something I am passionate about with sports and turned it into a website I am proud to share. I know there is much more I can accomplish and that this is just the begining of my web design journey. I look forward to seeing what areas I can improve on and will keep on practicing. </p>
